Ubercube is a first person shooter multi-player game set in a completely destroyable voxel world. The map can be procedurally generated or pre-made.

This is a reboot of the [old original project](https://github.com/ubercube/ubercube), this new Ubercube is written in C# with OpenGL. It aims to be easly moddable with the possiblity to create plugins.
